"""What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

ans> A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements in Python. 
    It's similar to a list but cannot be modified once created. 
    Tuples are often used to represent groups of related data that should remain constant.


    Lists and Tuples in Python are two classes of Python Data Structures. 
    The list structure is dynamic, and readily changed whereas the tuple structure is static and cannot be changed.
    This means that the tuple is generally faster than the list. 
    Lists are denoted by square brackets and tuples are denoted with parenthesis.
