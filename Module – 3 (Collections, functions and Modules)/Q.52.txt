How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?


Built-in functions: These functions are part of the Python standard library 
                    and can be used directly without importing any modules.
                     Examples include print(), len(), input(), type(), etc.

User-defined functions: These functions are created by the programmer using the def keyword.
                         They can take input parameters and return a value.

Lambda functions: These are anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.  
                They are often used for simple expressions.

Recursive functions: These functions call themselves directly or indirectly.   
                    They are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
