"""What are oops concepts? 

Ans = Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to design computer programs. 
The core concepts of OOP are:

Abstraction: Hides complexity and only shows relevant information

Encapsulation: Protects data in a class from system-wide access

Inheritance: Allows a child class to inherit fields and methods from a parent class

Polymorphism: Allows an action to be performed in different ways
